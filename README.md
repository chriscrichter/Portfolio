# Portfolio
My professional portfolio


Welcome to my Portfolio site. Here you will find information about me and my projects. This site was built with HTML and CSS files.


## Site Structure

The site is simple right now consisting of an About Me page and a Portfolio and Contact page. I hope to add more to it in the future.

As my first assignment in the Columbia Univeristy Engineering Coding Bootcamp, I was given strict instructions on how to build the site.
